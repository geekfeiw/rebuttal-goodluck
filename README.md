# Examples of Rebuttal or Response to Reviewers

We are struggling with conference/journal rebuttal or response to reviewers :weary:. To make rebuttal effective, i.e, to get rating raised, I am studying good responses in ICLR, and would like to share the findings. Please feel free to pull requests for your knowledges. （NLP guys please advance AutoRebuttal :new_moon_with_face:）
